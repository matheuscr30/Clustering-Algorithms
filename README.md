# Clustering-Algorithms

A python implementation of some clustering algorithms

## Algorithms

* FillMissingValues - Algorithm that fills missing values in datasets
* Distance - Algorithm for calculate the distance matrix between all values in datasets
* KMeans - Algorithm that separates the dataset values in groups using kMeans
* SingleLink - Algorithm that uses single link to build a hierarchical tree with the values in datasets
* Purity - Algorithm that evaluates the purity of clusters generated by differents executions of Kmeans
* SimplifiedSilhouette - Algorithm that evaluates the clusters generated by executions of Kmeans using silhouette measure

Instructions for running the algorithms are in the folders
